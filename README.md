 Here We Have three tasks for concept programming 
the first task is daily steps tracker(Description:
You have a list of the number of steps taken each day in a month. Your task is to write a program that performs the following:
1-Accepts the number of steps taken each day in the month as numbers separated by spaces.
2-Calculates the highest and lowest step counts.
3-Calculates the average daily step count.
4-Sorts the step counts in descending order.
)

The second one is library book borrowing analysis(Description:
You have a record of books borrowed from a library for a month. Each record includes the book title and the number of days  of it was borrowed. Your task is to write a program that performs the following:
Accepts a list of borrowed books wirrowed th the format: "Book Title - Days Borrowed".
Calculates the most and least borrowed book based on the number of days.
Calculates the average number of days books were borrowed.
Finds the unique titles of all borrowed books.
Sorts the books by the number of days borrowed in descending order.
Requirements:
1-Use a dictionary to store book titles as keys and their total borrowed days as values. (search)
2-Use a set to find unique titles of books borrowed. (search) 
3-Calculate the most and least borrowed book, the average borrowing time, and sort books by borrowing duration.
)

The third one is Word scramble game(Description:
Create a word scramble game where the program randomly scrambles a word and gives the player a set number of attempts to guess the original word.
Requirements:
1-The program should start by selecting a random word from a predefined list of words.
2-The selected word should be scrambled (characters shuffled in a random order).
3-Display the scrambled word to the player and ask them to guess the original word.
4-The player should have 5 attempts to guess the word correctly.
5-For each incorrect guess, the player should be informed how many attempts they have left.
6-If the player guesses correctly within the attempts, display a congratulatory message.
7-If the player runs out of attempts, reveal the original word.
8-Handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., empty input).
)
